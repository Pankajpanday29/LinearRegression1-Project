# LinearRegression1-Project
**Project Title :**Predict the heart attack disease for organisationld**WHO(Wor Health Organisation)**, using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will incresaing and decreasing.
**Problem Statment :** The World Health Organisation estimated 17 million death records. Half of the death result is found by us. The reasearch scholar point out the most relavent rsik factor of heart attack as a data science engineer predict the overall risk using machin learning algorithm logistic regression. 

Task 1: Import the libraries which required for the the prediction

Task 2: Import the dataset by your work space.

Task 3: Use the appropiate of sklearn libarary to train,test and aplit the dataset.

Task 4: Fit your values with arange function using feature sacling.

Task 5: Check your model accuracy and precision using confusion matrix

**conclusion**: According to model analysis the LogisticRegression algorithm works succesfully with 0.6 accuracy.
The accuracy shows that building the model is succesfull.
